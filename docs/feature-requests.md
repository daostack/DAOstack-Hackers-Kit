  - üî• We would like to see this feature implemented, lets discuss the specs
  - üçé We have prepared the specs but currently no dev team is working on it
  - ‚è∞ A Dev team has started working on it



| Feature | Stack Layer | Description | Dev Time | Status | Github Issue Link |
| ------- | -------------| ---------- | ------- | -------- | ---------- |
| DAO to DAO relations | Alchemy | Allow DAOs to interact with other DAOs by submitting proposals for voting / staking (/ proposing) | 2 w | üçé | [#27](https://github.com/daostack/Ecosystem/issues/27) |
| Buy GEN with ETH or any token | Alchemy | Integrate uniswap / kyber widget to allow the user to directly stake with eth or any other token which will be converted to gen. | 2 w | üçé | [#1](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-collab/issues/1) |
| Prediction bot | External | A bot that will make predictions on daos. It can use public training data as past proposals by the proposer or voters who voted for or against the proposal etc | 2-3 w | üî• | [#6](https://github.com/daostack/Ecosystem/issues/6) |
| Better representation of the protocol. Help Mode | Alchemy | Added tooltips, tours, walkthroughs that explain the genesis protocol | 2 w | üî• | [#15](https://github.com/daostack/Ecosystem/issues/15)
| Notification Bot for Alchemy | Alchemy | Allow users to subscribe for telegram/email/twitter etc. notification for activities in DAO | 2 w | üçé | [#7](https://github.com/daostack/Ecosystem/issues/7) |
| Improved Scheme Registrar UX | Alchemy | A more simplistic and abstracted interface in order to change the Genesis parameters without wanting to commit seppuku. | 2 w | üçé | [#11](https://github.com/daostack/Ecosystem/issues/11) |
| DAO treasury management | Alchemy | Enable DAO to manage its treasury by re-appropriating its funds via decentralized exchange or deFi Projects | 2 w | üçé | [#3](https://github.com/daostack/Ecosystem/issues/3), [#2](https://github.com/daostack/Ecosystem/issues/2), [#4](https://github.com/daostack/Ecosystem/issues/4), [#5](https://github.com/daostack/Ecosystem/issues/5)|
| Hashtags | Caching & Alchemy | Proposers can freely tag their proposals (e.g. #idea, #norm, #bounty etc), and then anyone can search / filter proposals by tags. Hashtags are case-insensitive (appear only with lower case). At first stage no admin, which means anyone can create any hashtag they want, and likely similarities will appear (#idea, #ideas, #ideation). Currently search available only inside DAO, can have cross-DAO search later| 2 w | üî• | - |
| GSN Integration | External | Allow users to participate without a cost, i.e. sponsor the gas fees <br/> - Allow another agent to pay for gas, technically <br/> - Who can pay for gas: the DAO? other agent? <br/> | 4 w| üçé |
| Twitter player integration | Alchemy | Allow people to interact with dao widgets (voting / proposing etc) inside twitter (e.g. https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1109263205606387712) | 3 w | üî• |
| DAO setup wizard integrated in Alchemy | Alchemy | Allow users to create a new DAO inside alchemy. This includes integrating with the DAO creator by dOrg, but also figuring out the indexing part | 4 w | üî• |
| Decentralized Social identity integration | Alchemy | Like the existing social identity but decentralised (https://3box.io) | 2 w | üî• |
| Unseen proposals indicator (in all DAOs) | Alchemy | When a user comes in to the platform again, there's an indication on the dashboard of the number of new proposals in each DAO since his last visited. | 1 w | üî• |
| Sorting reputation holders | Alchemy, Caching & Client | Sorting Reputation holders by: Reputation (top to bottom / bottom to top), Time joined (?), Most active (?), ... ? | 2 w | üçé | -
| Mark proposal as "read" / Fade inactive proposal | Alchemy | A user can mark a proposal as "read" and it will then be hidden from the interface. The user can toggle a "view all" switch to see all the proposals even those she chose to hide... A state change for the proposal (queued > pre-boosted) should reset this flag | 3 w | üî•
| Alchemy dashboard | Alchemy & Caching | This would show stats about the entire DAOstack ecosystem - no. daos, no. proposals, gen staked etc... Could be part of the DAO explorer | 2 w | üî•
| Aggregated boosted proposals view | Alchemy | Show the boosted proposals from all the DAOs. This will be useful for predictors | 2 w | üî• |
