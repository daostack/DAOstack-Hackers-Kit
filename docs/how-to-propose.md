All grants proposals must be submitted directly to the Genesis DAO and must be passed by the Genesis members to get funded.

We will use [DAOstack-collab repo](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-collab) to coordinate and reduce information asymmetries for developers builders in the DAOstack ecosystem.

  - Choose from the list of [Open Issues](../feature-requests) or work on your idea if you think it aligns with the Community's goal
  - Use the [Proposal template](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-collab/blob/master/proposals/_template.md) to create your own proposal document.
  - Create new PR to [DAOstack-collab repo](https://github.com/daostack/DAOstack-collab/pulls) to add your proposal document
  - Create a new Contribution proposal in [Genesis DAO](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x294f999356ed03347c7a23bcbcf8d33fa41dc830/scheme/0x28c5b9efd5bdec2c69c613d2df4b5e1b92e44a2d3c2f5092fb45187570029009/proposals/create/) and add `link to PR in the URL section` of the proposal
  - Fill in the details in proposal create form and submit the proposal (This will send tx to Blockchain).

NOTE: The PR will be merged if Genesis passes the proposal
