# Alchemy

Arc.js library facilitates development of "dApps" (Decentralized applications) for interacting with DAOs.

**DAOstack has built its own dApp called [Alchemy](https://alchemy.daostack.io/), a front-end interface for DAOs**, or more specifically, for budget management in decentralized organizations. Alchemy allows end users to make collaborative budgeting decisions and Ethereum blockchain interaction of any kind using the [Holographic Consensus protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1De0MoStSkY&feature=youtu.be&t=11m50s).

You can find the Alchemy repo at [github.com/daostack/alchemy](https://github.com/daostack/alchemy).

Note: Alchemy 2 is on branch https://github.com/daostack/alchemy/tree/master-2
